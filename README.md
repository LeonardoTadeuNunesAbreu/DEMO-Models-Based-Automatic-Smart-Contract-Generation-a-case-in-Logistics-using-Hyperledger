# DEMO Models Based Automatic Smart Contract Generation: a case in Logistics using Hyperledger

This repository is a suport for the article that presents a practical research project aimed at developing a method for automatically generating smart contracts using the DEMO methodology to facilitate the adoption of smart contracts in business processes. The study focuses on the logistics industry and uses Hyperledger Fabric as the blockchain platform. The main contributions are a mapping from the DEMO language to Hyperledger Chaincode using GO, as well as an evolution of DEMO's Action Model Grammar, that enable specification of necessary elements for automatic smart contract generation. The proposed approach extends the DEMO methodology so that it includes a smart contract concern, enabling the generation of reusable action rule specifications and other elements necessary for smart contract generation. Our research contributes to combining the strengths of the DEMO methodology and smart contracts. The design and implementation considerations of this approach are discussed in detail, and the results can be applied in future business cases requiring enterprise interoperability supported by distributed ledger technology.
